Measurement Method,Reliability Score,Rationale for Reliability Score,Reference
BDA (≥10 kDa),0.8,"High molecular weight BDA (≥10 kDa) primarily undergoes anterograde transport and can depict axonal terminals at Golgi-like resolution with minimal background staining and cytotoxicity, showing high reproducibility. However, signal attenuation occurs over long-distance pathways and requires optimization of survival periods. Given high but not perfect reliability, scored as 0.80.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1381034/
BDA (3 kDa),0.75,"Lower molecular weight BDA such as 3 kDa exhibits increased retrograde components, enabling bidirectional labeling from a single injection, but incorrect concentration or survival period can cause non-specific precipitation.

Rabies ΔG monosynaptic,0.68,"ΔG rabies provides high-resolution input mapping with single-step retrograde specificity, but helper AAV expression and toxicity can result in incomplete labeling. Scored as 0.68.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17329205/
AAV9,0.65,"AAV9 exhibits bidirectional transport (both anterograde and retrograde) but efficiency is pathway-dependent, with high vascular transduction leading to off-target spread. Scored as 0.65.",https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7556953/
PRV-Bartha,0.55,"PRV-Bartha is multisynaptic retrograde and can trace entire circuits, but infection control is difficult and toxicity is high. Scored as 0.55.",https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4165084/
